Magnetohydrodynamics of the Sun is a completely new up-to-date rewrite from scratch of the 1982 book Solar Magnetohydrodynamics, taking account of enormous advances in understanding since that date. 

<p>It describes the subtle and complex interaction between the Sun's plasma atmosphere and its magnetic field, which is responsible for many fascinating dynamic phenomena. 

<p>Chapters cover the generation of the Sun's magnetic field by dynamo action, 
<br>magnetoconvection and the nature of photospheric flux tubes such as sunspots, 
<br>the heating of the outer atmosphere by waves or reconnection, 
<br>the structure of prominences, 
<br>the nature of eruptive instability and magnetic reconnection in solar flares and coronal mass ejections, 
<br>and the acceleration of the solar wind by reconnection or wave-turbulence. 

<p>It is essential reading for graduate students and researchers in solar physics and related fields of astronomy, plasma physics and fluid dynamics.
